Pilot Cargo
===========
Data for [Pilot](https://github.com/wartman/pilot), based heavily on [Coconut.Data](https://github.com/MVCoconut/coconut.data) and [Tink State](https://github.com/haxetink/tink_state).

Not usable yet -- consider this a proof-of-concept.

Features
--------

Setting `-D pilot-cargo-constant` in your HXML will generate classes *without* using `tink_state`, which might be useful for targets (like PHP) that won't benefit from reactive programming.
